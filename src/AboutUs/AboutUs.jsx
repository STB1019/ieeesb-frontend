        IEEE Student Branch of Brescia is the reference for the IEEE (Institute
        of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) in Brescia. Our main goal is to
        integrate the modus operandi of scientific research into the academic
        and professional career of each member, this takes place through group
        projects or individual research in different fields of IT.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        The Branch offers the opportunity to research at the same level as IEEE
        members from around the world, while remaining completely immersed in
        the academic environment, with the support of the teaching staff and
        doctoral students.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        The possibility to get in touch realities other than purely scholastic
        allows one to have a different vision about what developing and
        maintaining a project mean, and also the ability to learn new concepts.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        In addition to the projects, we give our members the opportunity to
        attend a conference, to talk about their project and the difficulties
        they have encountered, as well as the things they have learned.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Within the site there are some of the projects we are developing or that
        we have carried out over the past year.
